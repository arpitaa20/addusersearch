so this is the front‑end part and here create a React application using Create-React-App named addusearch. In this project replace the default App.js with the updated App.js code which includes two components one is for adding a user (with a form that validates input and sends a POST request to /addUser) and another one is for listing users (which fetches data from /queryUser and provides a search feature). and also add the provided App.css file to style the application. This css centers all content on the page using flexbox sets a light background and styles the form fields & buttons & tables with a formal with clean look. If using a proxy (configured in your package.json) to forward API requests to the back‑end part and here make sure that the proxy value matches the back‑end’s URL and port.. for example proxy: http://localhost:8080. Now run the React app with npm start and ensure that the back‑end server is running so that the front‑end can successfully connect to it.
